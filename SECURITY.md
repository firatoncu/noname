# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the **n0name** trading bot seriously and welcome contributions from the community to help identify and address potential vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow the steps below to report it responsibly.

### How to Report
To report a vulnerability, please include the following details in your report to help us understand and address the issue efficiently:
- A clear description of the vulnerability, including the affected component or functionality.
- Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
- Any potential impact you foresee (e.g., data exposure, unauthorized access, or trading disruptions).
- Your contact information for follow-up communication.


### Response Timeline
Once you submit a vulnerability report:
- **Acknowledgment**: You can expect an initial acknowledgment of your report within **48 hours** of submission.
- **Updates**: We will provide periodic updates on the status of your report approximately every **7-14 days**, depending on the complexity of the issue.
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within **30 days** of confirmation, though timelines may vary based on the nature and scope of the issue.

### What to Expect
- **If Accepted**: If we confirm the vulnerability, we will work to develop and deploy a fix as quickly as possible. You will be credited for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) in our release notes or acknowledgments section, and we may reach out for additional input during the resolution process.
- **If Declined**: If the reported issue is determined to be a non-vulnerability (e.g., intended behavior, out of scope, or unexploitable), we will provide a detailed explanation of our reasoning. You’re welcome to follow up if you have additional evidence or questions.

### Scope
This vulnerability reporting process applies to the core **n0name** trading bot codebase and its direct dependencies. Issues related to third-party services (e.g., Binance API) or user misconfiguration are generally out of scope, though we’re happy to assist with troubleshooting where possible.

### Responsible Disclosure
We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we’ve had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and address it. This helps protect our users and maintain the integrity of the project.
