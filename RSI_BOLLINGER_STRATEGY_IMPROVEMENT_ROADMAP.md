# RSI & Bollinger Bands Strategy Improvement Roadmap

## Executive Summary

After analyzing your current RSI & Bollinger Bands strategy implementation, I've identified several areas for optimization specifically for 1-minute timeframe trading with full wallet balance utilization. This roadmap provides a detailed analysis of inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.

## Current Strategy Analysis

### Strategy Logic Overview
Your current strategy combines three main conditions:
1. **RSI Momentum Check** (`rsi_momentum_check`)
2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Check** (`bollinger_squeeze_check`) 
3. **Price Breakout Check** (`price_breakout_check`)

All three conditions must be `True` for a trade signal to be generated.

### Current Implementation Issues

#### 1. **RSI Thresholds Are Inadequate for 1-Minute Trading**
- **Issue**: Current thresholds (RSI > 60 for buy, RSI < 40 for sell) are too conservative for 1-minute charts
- **Problem**: 1-minute timeframes have more noise, requiring more sensitive thresholds
- **Impact**: Missing many profitable opportunities due to overly strict RSI conditions

#### 2. **Bollinger Band Squeeze Logic Is Flawed**
- **Issue**: Squeeze check uses 20th percentile of last 100 periods, which is static and doesn't adapt to market volatility
- **Problem**: In 1-minute charts, volatility changes rapidly, making static thresholds ineffective
- **Impact**: False signals during normal volatility periods

#### 3. **Price Breakout Check Has Conflicting Logic**
- **Issue**: Uses both Bollinger Band breakout AND percentile-based price levels simultaneously
- **Problem**: The percentile calculation (`percentile90` and `percentile10`) conflicts with Bollinger Band logic
- **Impact**: Overly restrictive conditions reducing trade frequency

#### 4. **Wave State Management Is Overly Complex**
- **Issue**: The RSI momentum check implements a complex 3-state system that's unnecessary for 1-minute trading
- **Problem**: Adds latency and complexity without significant benefit on fast timeframes
- **Impact**: Delayed signal generation and missed opportunities

#### 5. **No Volume Confirmation**
- **Issue**: Strategy ignores volume analysis
- **Problem**: Price movements without volume are less reliable
- **Impact**: Higher false positive rate

#### 6. **Static Parameters Don't Adapt to Market Conditions**
- **Issue**: All parameters are hardcoded (RSI period=14, BB period=20, etc.)
- **Problem**: Different market conditions require different parameter sets
- **Impact**: Suboptimal performance across various market phases

#### 7. **No Position Sizing Optimization**
- **Issue**: Uses full balance without considering market volatility or confidence levels
- **Problem**: Risk not adjusted based on signal strength
- **Impact**: Potential for significant losses during adverse conditions

## Detailed Improvement Plan

```

### Phase 3: Risk Management Optimization (Medium Priority)

```yaml
Current: Fixed full balance usage
Proposed: Dynamic allocation based on:

- Market volatility (ATR-based adjustment)
- Recent performance (Kelly Criterion integration)
- Drawdown protection (reduce size after losses)
```

#### 3.2 Intelligent Stop Loss and Take Profit
```yaml
Current:
- Fixed TP: 0.3% (Long), 0.3% (Short)
- Fixed SL: 1% (Long), 1% (Short)

Proposed:
- Volatility-adjusted TP/SL using ATR
